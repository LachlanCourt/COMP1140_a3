# COMP1140 - Databases and Information Management
## Assignment 3
This assignment was the culmination of three assignments worth of work in which each assignment built on the last. This is the final result
### Task
Create a new resource management system using SQL based on requirements discussed with the academic acting as a client. The report should involve requirements analysis, an Enhanced Entity Relationship model, and a number of tables detailing how the data would be stored in the database. All tables should be normalised to Boyce-Codd Normal Form if possible, or Third Normal Form if not. The database should finally be implemented in SQL with some sample data, and some supplied queries should be implemented to demonstrate the database.
